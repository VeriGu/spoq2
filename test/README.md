# spoq regression tests

`SpoqTest` is a GoogleTest driver, built as part of the default build. Because
the CMake target depends on `spoq`, building or running it always rebuilds the
executable under test first, and the path to it is baked in at configure time —
the tests can never run against a stale binary.

    make SpoqTest && ./build/SpoqTest      # all cases
    ./build/SpoqTest --gtest_filter=Spoq.attr_readonly
    ctest                                  # one ctest entry per case
    ctest -R attr_readonly

Set `SPOQ_TEST_KEEP=1` to keep each scratch directory for inspection.

A test is three files sharing a stem:

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `<test>.ll` | the module under analysis |
| `<test>.main.v` | the spoq configuration, self-contained |
| `<test>.expected.json` | the fields of spoq's result JSON that are pinned |

The driver assembles each case in its own scratch directory, assembles the `.ll`
to the `.bc` that `PROJ_BC_PATH` names (in process, via the same LLVM spoq links
against), runs spoq there, and compares only the keys present in the expected
file — timings and leaf counts are ignored, so only the semantic verdict is
pinned.

Cases are discovered at run time, so adding a triple of files needs no build
change; re-run `cmake` only if you want the new case to get its own `ctest`
entry.

`archive/` holds the older ad-hoc fixtures; they are ignored because they have no
`.expected.json`.

## function_attributes/

These exercise spoq's use of LLVM function attributes. Each one is written so
that it **cannot** be verified without them: the callee is an external
declaration, so its result state is otherwise unconstrained and the value read
back from a global after the call is unknown.

| test | attribute on the callee | expected | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `attr_readnone` | `memory(none)` | `verified: true` | callee touches no memory, so the state survives the call |
| `attr_readonly` | `memory(read)` | `verified: true` | callee cannot write, so the state survives the call |
| `attr_writeonly` | `memory(write)` | `verified: false` | negative control — a callee that may write must not be assumed harmless |

`src/` holds the C the `.ll` files were compiled from, with
`clang -S -emit-llvm -fno-discard-value-names -O1 -Xclang -disable-llvm-passes`
(matching how `examples/synthetic` builds its IR). `attr_writeonly.ll` then has
`memory(write)` substituted by hand, since C has no attribute that spells it.

## Attribute disposition

Every function attribute appearing in the reference corpus
(`~/workspace/patchverification/examples`), and what spoq does with it:

**Used.** `memory(none)` / `readnone`, `memory(read)` / `readonly` — the callee
provably never writes, so the call's output state is its input state.

**Deliberately unused, unsound to exploit as-is:**

- `memory(write)` / `writeonly`, `memory(argmem: ...)` / `argmemonly` — permit
  *some* write, so nothing follows about the state as a whole. Refining this
  would mean modelling which locations a call may touch, not just whether it
  writes at all.
- `inaccessiblememonly` — only touches memory the program cannot reach, so it
  arguably preserves the *observable* state, but spoq's `RData` does not draw
  that distinction. Two occurrences in the corpus; not worth the subtlety.

**Not yet implemented, would be sound and useful:**

- `noreturn` — control never continues past the call, so the continuation could
  be replaced by `None` outright. Today users hand-write this, e.g.
  `Definition exit_spec (v_0: Z) (st: RData) : (option RData) := None.`
- `willreturn` + `nounwind` (+ `mustprogress`) — the call returns normally,
  which could justify discharging the `None` branch at a call site.

**Not useful to spoq's model:** `nofree`, `nosync`, `nocallback`, `norecurse`,
`speculatable` — these constrain concurrency, recursion and allocator
behaviour that `RData` does not model.
